# Multi-Output-Regression-Models-
This model was trained on an earthquake observation parameters which has 200 input features and 19 target values.

Multioutput regression are regression problems that involve predicting two or more numerical values given an input features.
In multioutput regression, typically the outputs are dependent upon the input and upon each other. This means that often the outputs are not independent of each other and may require a model that predicts both outputs together or each output contingent upon the other outputs.
